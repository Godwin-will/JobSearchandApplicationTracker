## **Business Use Case:**  

### **Problem Statement**  
<p align="justify">
Since completing my master's thesis in January 2025, I have applied to numerous job openings and had a couple of interviews but I have faced challenges in effectively managing my job applications, tracking application statuses, remembering follow-up dates, and identifying which job roles or industries yielded me more interview opportunities. Interestingly from my research, I found that <b>59% of job seekers find the job search process as time-consuming as a full-time job</b>, and <b>77% lose track of crucial follow-up opportunities</b>, leading to missed chances and inefficiencies as stated by an Article published by ResponseSource. Therefore, I decided to develop a solution that streamlines application tracking and provides insights into job search performance.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Extraction:** Power Automate extracts real-time job listings from the **Jooble API (REST API integration)** based on user input in **Power Apps**.  
2. **Data Processing:** Extracted job data (Job Title, Location, and Job Link) is processed and formatted within **Power Automate** before being sent to **Power Apps** for display.  
3. **Data Storage:** Users save job applications via a form in **Power Apps**, and the details (job title, company, application status, etc.) are stored in **SharePoint Lists** for tracking.  
4. **Data Automation:** Power Automate updates and modifies job application statuses dynamically in **SharePoint Lists**, ensuring real-time data consistency.  
5. **Data Loading:** SharePoint List data is connected to **Power BI** via a Streaming Data API for continuous updates and real-time analytics.  
6. **Data Visualization:** Power BI generates interactive dashboards to provide insights into application status, success rates, and job search trends.
